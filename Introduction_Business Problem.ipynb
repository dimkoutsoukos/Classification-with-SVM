Therefore, insurance market is one of the most vluable market around the world. But insurance companies need to know how to evaluate their clients and maximize their effectiveness. In this case Data Science can offer an additional tool to solve this problem. Having a modern way to determine wheather a potential client is healthy or has the possibility to develop health problems, can save time and money for the insurance companies.

For the needs of this project, we will classify the clients as healthy or as prone to develop a heart condition. Using the data we are going to train a machine learning algorythm to classify anonymous clients as healthy or not, and then check the accuracy of our model.

This is a project that will be primarly used to detect heart diseases and if the usage works according to the plan, it can be later used for further examination. Note that we will have to evaluate the model with later feedback. In case the insurance company wants to proceed to use the model for other diseases, the current dataset needs to be updted with more statistics and used to classify other conditions."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
